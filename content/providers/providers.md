### Other categories to come...

This page will become the landing page for further information about companies and their services. Most of the services listed are on Someone Else's Computer, but there are a few self-hosted options. The first services I'm looking into are listed above, in no particular order. First, we will gather information about the security and privacy rules that companies have for their servers or those they rent from a farm. Examples would be not only the standards they use on their hardware, but also the standards they use on site. I am aware of the security measures in my residence, so why not consider the same for my digital life? If you would like to see any other providers added to the first set, please reach out on [Mastodon](https://social.lol@robertdalton)

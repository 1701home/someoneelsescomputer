 
# Someone Else's Computer

### Beginnings

I originally bought someoneelsescomputer.net as a funny catch-all for random people and companies that ask for my email address. As I have thought more about what else I can do with the domain, I thought of a new idea.

### The Idea

After much thought, I decided to create a site to document "cloud providers" security and privacy practices to see how they align with your personal "creep factor." This will also need to state the ease of use for each provider, to show all three points of the "SPE triangle." The "SPE triangle" will be a guide for people to find the best option for themselves.

### The Plan

My plan is to create a simple Hugo site and host it on GitHub, where I hope others can help contribute to the knowledge database. I will start with well-known providers, and move on from there. If there are any special requests, please feel free to reach out via Contact Info.
Timeline

I am hoping to have the site up within the next month, with the GitHub repository open to everyone. Follow me on Mastodon for more updates.
